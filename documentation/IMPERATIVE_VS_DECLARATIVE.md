 # Imperative vs. declarative programming

You're writing the steps for how the user interface should be updated. But when it comes to building user interfaces, a **declarative approach** is often preferred because it can speed up the development process. Instead of having to write DOM methods, it would be helpful if developers were able to declare what they want to show (in this case, an h1 tag with some text).

In other words, **imperative programming is like giving a chef step-by-step instructions on how to make a pizza**. **Declarative programming is like ordering a pizza without being concerned about the steps** it takes to make the pizza.



**React** is a popular **declarative library** that you can use build user interfaces.



 # React: A declarative UI library

As a developer, you can tell React what you want to happen to the user interface, and React will figure out the steps of how to update the DOM on your behalf.
