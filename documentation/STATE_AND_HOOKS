React has a set of functions called hooks

**Hooks** allow you to add additional logic such as state to your components. 
You can think of state as any information in your UI that changes over time, usually triggered by user interaction.

You can use **state** to store and increment the number of times a user has clicked the "Like" button. 
In fact, the React hook used to manage state is called: **useState()**

Add **useState()** to your project. 
It returns an array, and you can access and use those array values inside your component using **array destructuring**:
