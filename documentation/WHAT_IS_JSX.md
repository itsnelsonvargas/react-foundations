 # What is JSX?

**JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript** that allows you to describe your UI in a familiar HTML-like syntax. The nice thing about JSX is that apart from following [three JSX rules](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx#the-rules-of-jsx), you don't need to learn any new symbols or syntax outside of HTML and JavaScript.

But browsers don't understand JSX out of the box, so you'll need a JavaScript compiler, such as a [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), to transform your JSX code into regular JavaScript.
