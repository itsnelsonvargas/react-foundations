You don't need to know exactly how React updates the UI to start using it, but if you'd like to learn more, here are some additional resources:

1. [UI trees](https://react.dev/learn/understanding-your-ui-as-a-tree)
2. [Writing markup with JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx)
3. [react-dom/server](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server) sections in the React Documentation.
